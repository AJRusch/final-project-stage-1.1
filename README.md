# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Recipe-Roulette-Final-Project

This is the first stage of my final project. I am building a recipe app that allows users to search, save/favorite recipes and skim what recipes are popular from week to week. I do apologize I completely skimmed the directions for the final project and did not notice that we were supposed to submit after we had the basic jsx markup down. So I have already connected parts of my api (search endpoint and the popular section), just to make sure they were functioning. I am still implementing the login/out, register, and favoriting functions yet.
